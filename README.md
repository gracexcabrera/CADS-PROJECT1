## Username Search Engine Application: HandleHuntr

If you have a username idea but find yourself constantly getting the "this username isn't available" eror, then this username finder will do just the job for you. When you type your username into the searchbar, you will be presented with a list of social media platforms that show whether or not your username is available. And to save your time, there will be two different sections showing the social media platforms that do have your username available, and those that do not.

## Features

Search for usernames across multiple social media platforms and networks. The application supports popular platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub. Users can search for a username by entering the name in a search box. The search results are displayed on the screen with links to any profiles that match the search query. Users can also filter the search results by platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you can simply visit the website and enter the username you want to search for in the search box. The application will display the results for you to browse through.
