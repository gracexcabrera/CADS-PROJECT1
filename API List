To build a username search engine application, you would need to use the following APIs:

Search API: This API will allow you to search for usernames based on user input. Examples of search APIs include Google Custom Search API and Bing Search API.

Social media APIs: You can use social media APIs like Twitter API, Instagram API, and Facebook Graph API to search for usernames on those platforms.

Authentication API: If you want users to log in and create accounts on your application, you would need to use an authentication API like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.

Database API: You can use a database API like MySQL or MongoDB to store and retrieve user data.

Geolocation API: If you want to search for usernames based on location, you can use a geolocation API like Google Maps Geolocation API.

Text analysis API: You can use a text analysis API like IBM Watson or Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze user input and provide relevant search results.

Note that the specific APIs you need may vary depending on the requirements of your application.
