As a user who is trying to find an available username for my social media account, I want to use a username search engine application to quickly check the availability of my desired username across multiple platforms.

When I open the application, I want to be able to enter my desired username into a search bar and see a list of popular social media platforms such as Youtube and Checkmarks

I want to be able to select the platforms I am interested in and see the availability status of my desired username across those platforms. If the username is already taken, I want to be able to see alternative suggestions or variations of the username that are available.

Additionally, I want to be able to create an account within the application to save my searched usernames and receive notifications if they become available in the future.

Overall, I want the username search engine application to be user-friendly, efficient, and provide me with a comprehensive search of my desired username across multiple platforms.
